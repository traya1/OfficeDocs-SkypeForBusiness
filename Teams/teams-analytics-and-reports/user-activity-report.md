# Microsoft Teams user activity report

The Teams user activity report gives you insight into the types of activities that users in your organization perform in Teams. For example, you can see how many users communicate through 1:1 calls, how many users communicate through channel messages, and how many users engage in private chat messages.

## View the user activity report

You must be an admin to make these changes. See [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles) to read about getting admin roles and permissions.

1. In the left navigation of the admin center, click **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **Teams user activity**.
2. Under **Date range**, select a range, and then click **Run report**.
