# USB audio and video devices certified for Microsoft Teams

The peripherals certification program ensures that USB peripherals such as headsets, speakerphones, webcams, and monitors, offer rich audio or video quality. Certified devices work out of the box (plug & play) with no additional configuration required, and offer call control with Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business. The products provide a great experience for end-users and administrators.

To explore devices tested and certified for Microsoft Teams, head over to the [Teams store](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices).

For more details on call control support with Teams, please read [control calls using a headset in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/Control-calls-using-a-headset-in-Teams-65d6e104-444d-4013-b8c2-f11317dd69a8).

## Understanding certification categories

Users donâ€™t need to replace previously certified devices when upgrading to Teams from Skype for Business.  All certified devices are supported for both Microsoft Teams users and for Skype for Business users, with a few differences in functionality.  Additionally certification provides further designation for certain device categories.

- **Skype for Business certified with Teams upgrade** Devices certified at this level were initially certified for Skype for Business. To deliver as much lifetime value to users as possible, Microsoft has worked with device manufacturers to deliver as much Teams integration as possible with these existing devices without any changes to the original hardware. The *hookswitch* button acts as a Teams button when not in a call, and may include additional functions over time.  Devices in this category may carry the Teams certification badge on marketing materials.
- **Certified for Microsoft Teams** Devices certified at this level indicate the newest devices certified, for a no-compromise Teams experience. These devices offer all of the benefits of prior certification and also include a dedicated Teams button with LED indicator. With most form factors, the Teams button will be an easy-to-find tactile button with the Teams logo. Microsoft continues to work with device manufacturers to deliver new value via firmware updates over time.

### Special usage designations

- **Premium Microphone for Open Office** All headsets are tested to provide clear audio, but open office and other noisy environments fulfill a greater challenge: to pick up clearly the voice of the headset user but not transmit the sound of their neighbors.
- **Meeting room size** Shared devices such as speakerphones and cameras have a supported usage distance and recommended distances may be reported differently by different manufacturers. To give customers clear guidance, all shared devices are tested at certification against well-defined rooms sizes and noise environments.

## End-user experience

### New Teams certification benefits

- Dedicated Teams button and LED indicator light.
- User notification of events and alerts from the Teams client (e.g., meeting starting, voicemail or missed call).
- Ability to activate the Teams client or respond to notification with a press of the button (e.g., to join a meeting).
- Certification designed for extensibility (new device/client features to be delivered via firmware update).

### Core certification benefits

- Automatic selection of default audio device and prioritization if multiple audio peripherals are present.
- Devices automatically register with the Teams client and are ready to use.
- Audio devices (e.g., headsets, and speakerphones) offer:
  - Basic call control across when used with a PC or a Mac devices. Basic controls include answer/hang-up, mute/unmute, and volume control.
  - Wide-band audio with no echo, distortion, or excessive glitches. Echo cancellation is also supported across devices.
- Video devices meet requirements for noise, color, image detail, jitter, latency, frame rate, and field of view.

## Administrator Experience

- No provisioning required
- All devices support firmware updates to allow new features and performance improvements.

If you are a manufacturer and want to join the certification program, see [How to Join](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/certification/how-to-join) for requirements and available programs.
